# Algorithm Design

This repository is dedicated to my weekly algorithm design practice through Kattis exercises.

## Weekly Challenges

Each week, I will tackle Kattis exercises that require the implementation of various algorithms.
These exercises serve as a practical way for me to reinforce algorithmic concepts and improve my problem-solving skills.

## Choice of Programming Language

I have the freedom to use any programming language of my choice, but I will stick to Python.
Python provides a concise and expressive environment for algorithm implementation.
