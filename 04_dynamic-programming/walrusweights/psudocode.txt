read n

read weights in to list: weights
create empty array with n elements: T

solve i:
    # opt(i) = take max from
    #             opt(i-2) + weight // take
    #             opt(i-1)
    take = solve(i-2) + weights[i-1]
    drop = solve(i-1) + 0
    T[i] = max(take, drop)
    return T[i]

print solve n
